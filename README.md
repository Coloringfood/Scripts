miscellaneous scripts


###Contents
* Write text = just types text for you
* Clear Sharepoint cache = might help if Sharepoint thinks the file is checked out when it's really checked in
* Download file = downloads a file (like a media file that the browser refuses to download and only opens in a window)
* Dvorak = two flavors: one that converts QWERTY TO Dvorak (not recommended) and another that converts Dvorak commands into QWERTY commands (recommended; it's much more useable). The first flavor has a GUI version that can be useful when using public or other people's computers.
* Website prank = opens a random website every ten minutes
* Clicker = just clicks really fast
* TNT = for creating towers of tnt in Minecraft (one tnt, 2 blocks, repeat)
